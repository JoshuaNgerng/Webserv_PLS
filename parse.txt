Server Block
A server block is used to define the configuration for a specific virtual server (usually identified by listen and server_name). It sets up general server-wide settings.
Location Block
A location block defines the configuration for handling requests to specific paths or URLs. It's often nested within a server block and can override certain server block settings for the specified path.
